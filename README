Camera Stuff
------------

Currently, this repository has Lightroom specific files related to a few Canon
cameras and the Panasonic GF1.

Feel free to fork and contribute more profiles and presets.


Presets
=======

* GF1 BW: Use this preset to quickly make an image from a raw file appear to
  have been shot with a GF1 in black and white JPEG mode.

* GF1 Dynamic Color 1 & 2: Some incomplete attempts to replicate the GF1's
  "dynamic color" JPEG mode in a preset.


Profiles
========

Included are dual-illuminant profiles for the following cameras:

* Canon D60
* Canon 5D MarkII
* Panasonic DMC-GF1

All profiles have been made under both daylight and incandescent lighting, using
an X-Rite (formerly Gretag Macbeth) ColorChecker. While they are made for my
specific cameras, they will likely work adequately for yours as well. However,
cameras do supposedly vary in color, so it might not be as good as a
custom-made profile specifically for your camera. (Still, it's probably better
than nothing.)
